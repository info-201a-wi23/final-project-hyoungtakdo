# Introduction

Kidz Bop is an organization that promises to deliver mainstream songs that are kid friendly. The Kiz Bop dataset, provided by The Pudding, shows hundreds of rows comparing censorships between the Kidz Bop lyrics and original lyrics. With this dataset, we wanted to analyze the categories used for censorship, the number of censorships per year, and how much value the censorships carry. Furthermore, we want to find out if the censorships offend any marginalized groups and if censorships have had more weight throughout the years. Understanding what is censored and how frequently those words are censored will give us a better understanding of how Kidz Bop views specific topics and can allow us to understand the reasons behind the censorship.

For our analysis, we are answering three main questions:

* Has the number of censorships per year grown since the start of this organization?

* How often were the categories used as a reason for censorship? Were any of these categories wrongly used?

* What kind of words are present in song lyrics but not censored in Kidz Bop songs? What are these specific words?

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

As we took a final look into this data, we had some key takeaways of our own that answered parts of our questions.

Our first question was asking if the number of censorship has grown. Well when we took a look at 2001, the start of our dataset, the number of censored words was 4. Meanwhile the most recent year 2019, the number of censored words was 450. A whopping 100X difference. That itself answers pretty much the whole question.

Our next question was how often our categories were used as the reason for censorship. Since each censored is part of a category, most might ask isn't the answer 100%? Well, there is one category that is called other, which takes censored words that weren't censored because of any categories but still got censored anyway. Taking that into account, this would mean that instead of 100%, it would be a 92% rate where categories were reasons for censorship. It is still a very high rate, however, just pointing out this part of the data allowed us to find an answer that we may not have found beforehand.

Finally, our last question for our dataset was what kind of words are present in the original lyrics that were not censored? To answer this, we looked at the dataset inside the tab Words VS Frequency. Out of all the categories, we noticed that the other category had the most instances of words in songs that were never censored with 14. I think this makes sense as the other categories have specific reasons for censorship while others aren't specifying any of the specific censored categories.

All in all, there is so much we can get out of this data. Not only that, we are able to use our findings from this data to search even deeper with outside searches. Were specific political movements and actions a causing factor? Was there an increase in songs of profanity? This dataset allows us to not just find answers, but to find deeper and more meaningful questions that will help create even better answers in the future.
